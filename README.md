# Purpose
My goal with the projects in this repo was to apply the skills I learned through [Microsoft's Learn to Program in in Java](https://www.edx.org/course/learn-to-program-in-java-2) course and build even more skills along the way!
## Projects
Here is a short description about each project in this repo.
* **TripPlanner**: an interactive program that asks users for their current location, travel destination, and travel budget and calculates the user's daily budget (in both USD and the location's currency) and the total distance to the destination.
* **Battleships**: an interactive program that allows the user to play a game of Battleships against the computer. The program first asks user to deploy his/her ships and then asks for coordinations at which user wants to fire. The game continues until either the computer or the user wins. 
* **Encryptor**: encrypts a message inputted by the user by shifting the alphabet order by one.
* **Decryptor**: decrypts the message encrypted by the encryptor program.
